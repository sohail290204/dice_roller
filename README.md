This React Native app simulates rolling a dice. Each time the button is pressed, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated, and the corresponding dice image is displayed along with the rolled number. Additionally, the history of rolled numbers is shown below the button. The app features light and dark mode themes, adapting its appearance based on the device's color scheme.
